Source Allies is a technology services company, powered by people in slippers!
Our goal is to be the preferred place of employment for collaborative technologists seeking mastery.

## Join our team!

Our partners tell us we act like *owners*, not renters.
Ownership means working towards the success of projects, not the completion of contracts.
Wether working from home or the office, our slippers symbolize this ownership mindset.
We are always looking for teammates and apprentices that enrich and improve our [culture](https://www.sourceallies.com/careers/), strengthen and broaden our [expertise](https://www.sourceallies.com/what-we-do/#our-expertise), and embody our [core values](https://www.sourceallies.com/#our-core-values).
