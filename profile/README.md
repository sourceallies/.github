Source Allies is a technology services company, powered by people in slippers! Our goal is to be the preferred place of employment for collaborative technologists seeking mastery.

## Join our team!

Our partners tell us we act like *owners*, not renters. Our slippers symbolize this ownership mindset. Renters wear shoes at home, but an owner takes them off as they come through the door. We wear slippers in the office for the same reason. We are always looking for teammates and apprentices that align with our [expertise](https://www.sourceallies.com/what-we-do/#our-expertise) and [core values](https://www.sourceallies.com/#our-core-values).
